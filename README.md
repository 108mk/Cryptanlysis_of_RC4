# Cryptanlysis of RC4
> As a part of E0-213 (coursework: Quantum Safe Cryptography) at IISc Bengaluru, we explored the crypt analysis of RC4 via the necessary literature review. We have summarized our findings in the attached documents.

## RC4 PNRG has primarily two categories of biases:
>  $\rightarrow$ Single byte biases

> $\rightarrow$ Consequitive byte biases

We have analysed both of them, as mentioned in the slides.

## We created the below meme. It (hopefully) will summarize the current scenario of RC4 as a Psuedo random number generator.
